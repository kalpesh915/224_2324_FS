    /*
        Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
        JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:
        Block scope, Function scope, Global scope
        
        Block Scope
        Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript variables had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
        ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
