The mouse pleaded, “Please, let me go, and someday I’ll repay your kindness.” The lion laughed but decided to let the mouse go. A few days later, the lion got caught in a hunter’s net. The mouse heard his roar, ran to him, and chewed through the ropes to free him. The lion was grateful and realized even small creatures can make a big difference.",
